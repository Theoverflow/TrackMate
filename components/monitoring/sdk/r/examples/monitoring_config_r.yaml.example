# Runtime Configuration Example for R SDK
#
# This file can be edited while the R application is running.
# The SDK will automatically detect changes and reload the configuration.
#
# NO R SESSION RESTART REQUIRED!

mode: "sidecar"  # or "direct"

app_name: "runtime-config-r-example"
app_version: "1.0.0"
site_id: "fab1"
instance_id: "r-runtime-001"

# Sidecar mode configuration
sidecar_url: "http://localhost:17000"
timeout: 5.0
max_retries: 3

# For direct mode, you would configure backend_type and backend_config instead:
# mode: "direct"
# backend_type: "filesystem"
# backend_config:
#   output_dir: "./monitoring_events"
#   filename_prefix: "r_events"

# USAGE:
#
# 1. Start with sidecar mode (default)
# 2. While application runs, change sidecar_url
# 3. Save file - SDK auto-reloads
# 4. Or switch to direct mode by changing mode: "direct"
# 5. All changes happen live without R session restart!
#
# Example changes to try:
# - Change sidecar_url to different endpoint
# - Switch mode from "sidecar" to "direct"
# - Modify timeout or max_retries values
